## 🎯 User Goals

This project is designed for individuals who need space to reconnect with their emotions, cultivate positivity, and prioritize rest.

In today’s fast-paced and demanding world, many people experience anxiety and emotional fatigue, often neglecting their own well-being. With constant responsibilities, expectations, and limited personal time, it's easy to lose touch with how we truly feel.

This web app aims to support users—especially those with busy schedules—by helping them recognize and reflect on their emotions throughout the day or week. By fostering emotional awareness and encouraging healthier habits, the app empowers users to make meaningful changes that enhance their mental and emotional well-being.
