## 🎯 User Goals

This project is designed for individuals who need space to reconnect with their emotions, cultivate positivity, and prioritize rest.

In today’s fast-paced and demanding world, many people experience anxiety and emotional fatigue, often neglecting their own well-being. With constant responsibilities, expectations, and limited personal time, it's easy to lose touch with how we truly feel.

This web app aims to support users—especially those with busy schedules—by helping them recognize and reflect on their emotions throughout the day or week. By fostering emotional awareness and encouraging healthier habits, the app empowers users to make meaningful changes that enhance their mental and emotional well-being.

# 🏁Main Project Goal

Design and develop a personal web app that is intuitive, minimalistic, and emotionally supportive—requiring little typing or effort from the user.

To foster emotional well-being, the app will also offer:

- 🎵 Access to relaxing music and ambient soundscapes
- 🌟 A curated selection of positive affirmations
- 🎙️ The ability to upload personal audio files—especially meditation tracks or custom affirmations

Ultimately, the goal is to create a digital space that helps users reconnect with themselves, reduce stress, and build healthier emotional habits—without demanding time or cognitive load.
